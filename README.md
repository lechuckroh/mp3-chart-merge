# mp3 chart merge

This script removes the ranking from the mp3 filename and moves to another directory.

For example,

`Billboard.2016.12.02/001.Black Beatles - Rae Sremmurd (feat. Gucci Mane).mp3` will be moved to `Billboard.2016/Black Beatles - Rae Sremmurd (feat. Gucci Mane).mp3`.

Spaces and special characters are removed from filename while duplication check. It prevents duplicate mp3 files of similar filename.
